Project Euler: Problem 11: Largest product in a grid

In the 20×20 grid below, four numbers along a diagonal line have been marked in red.

The product of these numbers is 26 × 63 × 78 × 14 = 1788696.

What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in a given arr grid?

largestGridProduct(testGrid) should return a number.
largestGridProduct(testGrid) should return 14169081.

testGrid = [
  [40, 17, 81, 18, 57],
  [74, 4, 36, 16, 29],
  [36, 42, 69, 73, 45],
  [51, 54, 69, 16, 92],
  [7, 97, 57, 32, 16]
